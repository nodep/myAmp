# myAmp

I've had this idea to build my own small, battery powered, guitar amplifier. I want to put it into the case of my old Marshall Valvestate 8010 that I've had since the mid '90s. The Marshall hasn't been working properly for a very long time, and I've felt bad throwing it out. So I will use it for science! Which is great because I hate making enclosures for my projects.

I don't really need an amp, but most of the electronics I did so far was about connecting ICs. Which is fun, but not what I am after at the moment.

This amp will have:

- Tone controls with bass/mid/treble. I want to experiment with different tone stacks (Fender, Marshall, Vox...)
- Switchable overdrive. Something warm and crunchy - not a hi-gain metal.
- Reverb / chorus with a FV-1 from Spin semiconductors. I've never done DSP programming, so that should be fun.
- A class D power amplifier. Probably a TPA3136D2. But I've done that already, so it will be the least interesting part of the circuit.
- Maybe an audio Bluetooth module for backing tracks.

I will probably replace the speaker that came with the Marshall at some point. It would be great if I could squeeze an 8" speaker instead of the original 6.5". But I doubt it will fit.

These are the plans. How far I get with them remains to be seen...

Stay tuned!
